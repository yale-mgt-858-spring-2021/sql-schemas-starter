# 

This assignment is a tad different than the other SQL assignments. Instead of
having many directories/questions each with an `answer.sql` file, here we just have a
single directory with a single `answer.sql` file. In that file you'll put a
bunch of SQL that will create a database schema. Then I'll run a bunch of 
tests on that schema to see if it conforms to the requirements that I articulate.



## Suggested order

We suggest you complete the questions in the following order

- [ ] 00-schema-test


As you complete questions, you can mark them as complete
in this Markdown file,  but you don't have to do so.
See [this example](https://github.blog/2014-04-28-task-lists-in-all-markdown-documents/).
